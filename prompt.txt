filtering device events (keyboard/mouse/etc.)
[EVENTS...] 
The print variable governs what events to print.
if empty print all events
This is mostly useful for debugging and for discovering what certain events are named.
For example, the following filter will print key b events
key b 0
key b 1
key b 2
For example, @foo will only print events that have domain foo, domain is the id of the input source for example "Corsair CORSAIR K100 RGB Optical-Mechanical Gaming Keyboard" or we can reassign to a custom name like foo.
If no filter is specified, all events are printed.
Format
The format should be printed like so:
key:a:1@/dev/input/by-id/keyboard
