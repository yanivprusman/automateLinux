1) calling from terminal a script in current directory that sudo calls a target script in the same directory
2) calling from terminal a script in current directory that sudo calls a target script in a different directory

bash vs sh
#!/bin/bash 
    solves  
    4: Bad substitution
    realpath BASH_SOURCE[0]: 

1) Invoked path:       how the script was called (e.g. /usr/local/bin/myscript â€” could be a symlink).
2) Real/resolved path: the actual file on disk after following symlinks
3) Sourced vs executed
    When a script is sourced (. script.sh or source script.sh) vs executed (./script.sh) some languages/shells expose different variables.
4) Absolute vs relative
    You usually want an absolute path. Use pwd -P/realpath/readlink -f or language APIs to canonicalize.

it is better to call
sudo $(realpath "$(dirname "$(reallink "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")/echo.sh")
sudo $(realpath "$(dirname "$(realpath "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")/echo.sh")
